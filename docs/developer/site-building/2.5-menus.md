# Menus


Menus are a collection of links (menu items) used to navigate a website. The core Menu UI module provides an interface to control and customize the menu system. Menus are primarily displayed as a hierarchical list of links. By default, new menu items are placed inside a built-in menu labeled Main navigation, but administrators can also create custom menus.

The core Standard installation profile contains five menus:

- **Main navigation** - Links to sections intended for site visitors. They are usually created by site administrators.

- **Administration** - Links to administrative tasks. This menu mainly contains links supplied by modules on your site.

- **User account menu** - Links to tasks associated with the user account such as My account and Log out.

- **Footer** - Links to important pages within the site intended for the footer. They are usually created by site administrators.

- **Tools** - Links to tasks necessary for site visitors. Some modules feature their links here.

## Menu Management

You can see all menus in your system by going to `Structure` -> `Menus`.

## Menu Placement

Menus are exposed in Drupal 8 as block, so you can use standard block placement to insert a menu onto your site.
