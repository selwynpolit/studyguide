# Menus

From [drupal.org - Concept: Menu](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/menu-concept.html):
> Menus are a collection of links (menu items) used to navigate a website. The core Menu UI module provides an interface to control and customize the menu system. Menus are primarily displayed as a hierarchical list of links. By default, new menu items are placed inside a built-in menu labeled Main navigation, but administrators can also create custom menus.
>>
> The core Standard installation profile contains five menus:
>>
> **Main navigation**
>
>   Links to sections intended for site visitors. They are usually created by site administrators.
>>
> **Administration**
> - Links to administrative tasks. This menu mainly contains links supplied by modules on your site.
>>
> **User account menu**
> - Links to tasks associated with the user account such as My account and Log out.
>>
> **Footer**
> - Links to important pages within the site intended for the footer. They are usually created by site administrators.
>>
> **Tools**
> - Links to tasks necessary for site visitors. Some modules feature their links here.

## Menu Management

### List menus
You can see all menus in your system by going to `Structure` -> `Menus`.

### Edit menu link
You can edit an existing menu link by clicking `Edit` next to the particular menu item you wish to modify on the menu edit page.

Menu items are sorted by weight, and can be parented to other menu items. If you want nested menu items to appear in menu blocks, you'll need to enable the `Show as expanded` option on the parent menu item, or `Expand all menu links` in the menu block options.

## Menu Placement

Menus are exposed in Drupal 8 as block, so you can use standard block placement to insert a menu onto your site.

See [Blocks](2.4-blocks.md) for more information about blocks in Drupal.
